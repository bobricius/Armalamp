Plastic covered photo cells + Supercapacitor with unlimited life ( 1369years )

Features:

- 6x BPW34 photodiodes aka solar cell
(plastic diodes, more resistant to damage against glass solar cell)

- Up to 20F supercapacitor
(You can use bigger capacity but 20F is optimal for charge in one sunny day)

- 4 hours operation in night depends on intensity

- Auto night on

- Step up converter effective use all stored energy, discharge scap until 0.3V !!!!!!

- Output is activated in night

SuperCapacitor can achieve 500 000 charging cycles, it is enough for 1369years.
(BPW34 photodiode act as solar cell, MCP1624 suck all stored energy to LED because can work until 0.3V)
